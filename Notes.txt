- Test the app to find out what's working properly and
  what isn't
  
- Behaviour: currently, restarting the app or doing a complete refresh
removes the id of the sections and any id references to those sections
(possibly related to the full re-syncing operation of the DB on startup)
(might be due to updated constraints not working with older data so it
gets omitted)
(fixed???)

- Behaviour: Adding fees does not work properly at the moment (fixed???)

- Performance: Issue when closing the app, at least in dev
  apears to leave running processes in the background sometimes???
  
- Consider splitting containers into two levels of containers
  one that handles the communication with the DB and the other
  handles the UI logic

- Consider adding an additional layer to the project's 
  architecture to contain the business logic and communicate
  with the Model layer.
  This layer could be considered as an API, so it should be
  well documented for any possible users who might interact
  with it.
  Consider also checking other projects for how they implement
  API functionality (like Winds application on github).
  On a quick glance of their API, one of the things that
  caught my eye is that functions can throw errors to be
  handled by the user of the API in case they misuse it.
