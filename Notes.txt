- Issue with the warning models and student.belongsToMany in db.js
- Unique Validation error in dev
- student.belongsToMany passed non sequelize.model subclass



- On win the app is installed (using the .exe setup) in
  users/{user}/AppData/local/Programs
- The following paths might also contain something related to the app
  (it might also be trash from previous testing with other frameworks)
  users/{user}/AppData/local
  users/{user}/AppData/Roaming ???

- Sequelize error thingy (bookmarked), add to resolved issues

- Should probably .ignore the db file

- Consider removing all unneeded deps from the boilerplate

- HOW TO INSTALL:
1. Clone/Download electron-react-boilerplate
2. Yarn install (make sure electron is less than 9.0)
3. Make sure to install sequelize and sqlite3 in the app dir
4. In the webpack.config file, add 'pg','tedious','pg-hstore'
    to the externals array (hotfix hack thingy for sequelize)
4. Fix the unterminated comment in WrapperLodash
5. Add the semantic-ui-css missing theme if its's missing
  (Just copy it from their repo or a previous project)
6. Yarn postinstall (rebuilds and shit)


- TESTING:
  - Types of tests that are relevant to the app relevant
    - Integration (How different pieces integrate together)
    - E2E (testing of a complete application environment in a
      situation that mimics real-world use)
    - Regression (Testing an application as a whole for the 
      modification in any module or functionality)
    - Alpha (Testing an application as a whole for the 
      modification in any module or functionality) manual or automated.
    - Beta (Testing carried out by the customer). Some companies
      release the whole product officially as Beta and leave it
      like that(like some games do).
    - Example Testing (includes the real-time scenario)
    - GUI (How shit looks, done manually better than atuomatically)
    - Happy path (Testing all the expected, desired scenarios)
    - Negative (Testing for cases known to be invalid/undesired)
    - Install/Uninstall Testing
    - Recovery Testing (How well the app recovers from a crash)
