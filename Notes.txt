- Behaviour: currently, restarting the app or doing a complete refresh
removes the id of the sections and any id references to those sections
(possibly related to the full re-syncing operation of the DB on startup)
(might be due to updated constraints not working with older data so it
gets omitted)

- Behaviour: Adding fees does not work properly at the moment

- Performance: Issue when closing the app, at least in dev
  apears to leave running processes in the background???
