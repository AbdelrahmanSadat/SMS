- Issue with the warning models and student.belongsToMany in db.js
- Unique Validation error in dev
- student.belongsToMany passed non sequelize.model subclass



- On win the app is installed (using the .exe setup) in
  users/{user}/AppData/local/Programs
- The following paths might also contain something related to the app
  (it might also be trash from previous testing with other frameworks)
  users/{user}/AppData/local
  users/{user}/AppData/Roaming ???
