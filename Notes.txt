- Issue with the warning models and student.belongsToMany in db.js
- Unique Validation error in dev
- student.belongsToMany passed non sequelize.model subclass



- On win the app is installed (using the .exe setup) in
  users/{user}/AppData/local/Programs
- The following paths might also contain something related to the app
  (it might also be trash from previous testing with other frameworks)
  users/{user}/AppData/local
  users/{user}/AppData/Roaming ???

- Sequelize error thingy (bookmarked), add to resolved issues

- Should probably .ignore the db file

- Consider removing all unneeded deps from the boilerplate

- HOW TO INSTALL:
1. Clone/Download electron-react-boilerplate
2. Yarn install (make sure electron is less than 9.0)
3. Make sure to install sequelize and sqlite3 in the app dir
4. In the webpack.config file, add 'pg','tedious','pg-hstore'
    to the externals array (hotfix hack thingy for sequelize)
4. Fix the unterminated comment in WrapperLodash
5. Add the semantic-ui-css missing theme if its's missing
  (Just copy it from their repo or a previous project)
6. Yarn postinstall (rebuilds and shit)



- Current Electron Version: 9.0.4 (9.0 had breaking changes)
- Desired Version 8.3.4 (Before the native module context thing)


- Adding a dependency (prettier 1.19.1) to a dependency 
  (@stardust-ui/docs-component) because it conflicts with
  the version of prettier used in the upper directory
- Scratch that. Added prettier 1.19.1 to the upper dir
- Scratch that. Didn't need it. Removed entirely and reverted
  prettier to its original version
