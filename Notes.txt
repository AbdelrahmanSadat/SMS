- Test the app to find out what's working properly and
  what isn't
  
- Behaviour: currently, restarting the app or doing a complete refresh
removes the id of the sections and any id references to those sections
(possibly related to the full re-syncing operation of the DB on startup)
(might be due to updated constraints not working with older data so it
gets omitted)
(fixed???)

- Behaviour: Adding fees does not work properly at the moment (fixed???)

- Performance: Issue when closing the app, at least in dev
  apears to leave running processes in the background sometimes???
  
- Consider splitting containers into two levels of containers
  one that handles the communication with the DB and the other
  handles the UI logic
